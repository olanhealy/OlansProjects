# Building Websites With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Getting Started
Used course on Plural sight to help me build my first proper website.
Changed the way I wanted the website to look and made it my own. 
This was just to get my foot in the door with html, css and javascript so I can hopefully build
my own websites in the future.
